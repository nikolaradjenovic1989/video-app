The challenge is to create a lightweight React App with 2 video players.

Each player should play the same video and stay locked in frame sync (each player shows the same frame).
App should work in stopped, single-step, and play modes.

The players should each have their native react transport controls.
Using the controls on one player should cause the other player to sync to the position commanded by the first player.
The app should also include a super control that simultaneously commands both players to do the same thing:
play, stop, etc.

A YouTube video is adequate to test the app. Animation video (anime) makes good test material as comparing
side-by-side video players for the same content is relatively easy.

The selected video file should be of 720p+ resolution.

While this challenge may seem simple in principle, you will need to adopt a synchronization strategy
to keep the players in sync.
